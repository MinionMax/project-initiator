## windows installation
For the script to work you will need the following:
- git
- python3
- pip (usually comes with python)
- doskey

Once you have all of the above installed you can start:

Open up the command prompt and navigate to your root directory:
```cmd
cd C:\users\name
```
First clone the repository:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/MinionMax/project-initiator
```
Then navigate to the folder:
```cmd
cd C:\users\name\project-initiator
```
Install the dependencies/requirements:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### note
Please check if you have doskey activated using "doskey help".
If doskey responds with commands you're good to go!<br/>
