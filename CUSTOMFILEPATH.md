# custom filepaths

Copy the path to the create.py script (path/to/create.py) and paste it to the SCRIPTPATHCREATE row do the same with the remove.py path to the SCRIPTPATHREMOVE row.
You will also need to adjust the filepath to the project_init.sh file in the your .bash_profile file as well as pasting the path to .env in the source calls in project_init.sh.

i mean just keep it in the root directory man.
