# project initiator

## about
The "project initiator" is a simple automation script to run from your command line.
It creates a folder in your destined projects folder, creates a readme and commits it to your github account. The script is available for Windows and Shell terminals.

## installation
<img height="32" width="32" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v3/icons/windows.svg" />
[mac](https://github.com/MinionMax/project-initiator/blob/master/DOCS/MACDOC.md)
<img height="32" width="32" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v3/icons/apple.svg" />
[win](https://github.com/MinionMax/project-initiator/blob/master/DOCS/WINDOC.md)

### important note
I wouldn't recommend moving the scripts to another folder.
For your convenience just keep it in your root directory.
If you are a file organization freak and want to move it anyway follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/MinionMax/project-initiator/blob/master/DOCS/CUSTOMFILEPATH.md).



_happy coding_
